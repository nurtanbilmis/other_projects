# The Machine Learning Toolkit: Algorithms and Techniques by Use-Case

This repository contains educational Jupyter notebooks explaining various machine learning algorithms and techniques, organized by use-case. Each algorithm is discussed in detail, including its ideal use-case, real-world examples, and limitations.

## Additional Resources

Image Generation: I use leonardo.ai to see how a text-to-image generator visualizes these concepts with simple prompts, hopefully making the notebooks more fun and engaging.

Video Tutorials: I've provided YouTube links to relevant content from various creators where I found the explanations to be simple and interesting. I highly recommend checking them out to deepen your understanding.
